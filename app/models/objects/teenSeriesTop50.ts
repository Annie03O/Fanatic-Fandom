        personality: "Brandon Walsh is portrayed as the moral center of Beverly Hills, 90210. He is intelligent, thoughtful, and deeply principled, often guided by a strong sense of right and wrong. Throughout the series, Brandon consistently tries to do what he believes is fair and ethical, even when it puts him in difficult situations. He is highly responsible and mature for his age, frequently acting as a voice of reason among his friends. Brandon often takes on leadership roles, whether as a student journalist, class president, or community advocate. He believes strongly in standing up for others and is not afraid to challenge authority when he feels something is unjust. Socially, Brandon is charismatic and approachable. He forms close relationships easily and is well-liked by both peers and adults. His empathy allows him to connect with people from different backgrounds, and he is usually willing to listen before judging. However, Brandon is not without flaws. He can be stubborn, self-righteous, and overly idealistic. At times, he struggles with seeing perspectives that differ from his own and may come across as judgmental. His desire to 'do the right thing' can sometimes turn into moral superiority, creating tension in his relationships. Emotionally, Brandon is loyal and caring, especially toward his twin sister Brenda and his close friends. He values honesty and commitment in romantic relationships but sometimes finds it difficult to balance his ideals with real-life complexities. Overall, Brandon Walsh represents the classic 'good guy' archetype: principled, compassionate, and driven by integrity, while still learning through mistakes and personal growth.",

Brandon plays a stabilizing role in Brenda’s life as she struggles to adjust to the new social dynamics of Beverly Hills, develop friendships, and navigate her romantic relationships. Brenda openly tells Brandon at one point that he is her best friend, and Brandon expresses that he hopes they always remain that close.",

Brandon cares deeply for Brenda, supports her through personal ups and downs, and is there for her during major moments in the early seasons. Overall, their relationship is portrayed as a strong familial bond rather than a romantic one, grounded in mutual support, shared experience as newcomers in Beverly Hills, and brother-sister loyalty."

Dylan longs for the steady family dynamic Brandon has always enjoyed and considers Brandon's parents his own surrogate parents, until Jim rejects him.

Unlike Kelly, who introduces Brenda to the school’s social hierarchy, Donna offers immediate kindness and emotional safety. She welcomes Brenda without judgment and treats her with warmth and sincerity. From the beginning, their bond is built on trust, gentleness, and mutual support rather than popularity or competition. Donna’s calm, non-confrontational nature balances Brenda’s emotional intensity, creating a friendship based on comfort and understanding.",
              "During the early seasons, Brenda and Donna develop a quiet but meaningful closeness. They often confide in each other about romantic struggles, family problems, and personal insecurities. Donna consistently acts as a listener and emotional anchor for Brenda, especially during moments of heartbreak involving Dylan and conflict with Kelly. In return, Brenda encourages Donna to be more confident and assertive, helping her express her feelings and stand up for herself. Their friendship functions as a safe space where both can be vulnerable without fear of judgment.",
              "Unlike many other relationships in the group, Brenda and Donna’s friendship is largely free from betrayal or rivalry. Even during periods of major group conflict—particularly after the Dylan-Kelly affair—Donna remains loyal to Brenda. She refuses to take sides in a way that would hurt her and often serves as a mediator within the group. Her loyalty helps Brenda feel less isolated during some of her most difficult emotional periods. This steadfast support strengthens their bond and distinguishes their friendship from the more turbulent relationships around them.",
              "As Brenda struggles with feelings of insecurity, displacement, and disappointment in later seasons, Donna continues to provide emotional stability. She encourages Brenda to prioritize her own well-being and self-respect, especially when Brenda questions her worth in relationships. Donna’s consistent presence reminds Brenda that she is valued for who she is, not for her romantic status or popularity. At the same time, Brenda supports Donna through her own challenges, including academic pressure and relationship issues, reinforcing their reciprocal loyalty.",
              "Their friendship also reflects their contrasting personalities. Brenda is passionate, expressive, and emotionally intense, while Donna is gentle, patient, and morally grounded. These differences rarely cause conflict; instead, they complement one another. Donna helps calm Brenda during emotional crises, while Brenda helps Donna become more courageous and self-assured. Together, they represent a balanced and emotionally healthy friendship within a group often marked by drama and instability.",
              "As the series progresses and Brenda begins to pursue her independence through acting and travel, her relationship with Donna remains steady. Even as their lives start to move in different directions, their emotional connection endures. There is no major rupture or betrayal that defines their separation; instead, their friendship fades naturally into a quieter, more mature bond based on mutual respect and shared history.",
              "By the time Brenda leaves the series, her friendship with Donna stands as one of her most positive and enduring relationships. Unlike her turbulent romances and complicated friendships, her bond with Donna remains rooted in loyalty, compassion, and emotional honesty. Ultimately, Brenda and Donna’s friendship represents the healthiest form of connection in the series—a relationship built on trust, empathy, and unwavering support, showing how genuine friendship can provide stability in an emotionally unpredictable world."

Their early relationship is passionate, loyal, and deeply romantic, with both seeing each other as their first true love.",

Brenda is devoted and idealistic, while Dylan finds emotional safety and stability with her for the first time in his life. Their bond is strengthened through shared vulnerability, including Dylan’s struggles with his family, wealth, and abandonment issues. Brenda often acts as his emotional anchor, while Dylan gives Brenda confidence and a sense of being truly chosen.",

Dylan becomes increasingly conflicted about his feelings, especially when Brenda is away in Paris during Season 3. During her absence, he grows close to Kelly Taylor, Brenda’s best friend. This leads to one of the most devastating betrayals in the series: Dylan and Kelly secretly begin a relationship behind Brenda’s back.",

The revelation permanently damages her trust and marks the emotional turning point of her character. Dylan expresses guilt and regret, but his inability to fully commit to Brenda contributes to their breakup.",

Despite moments of tenderness and renewed intimacy, unresolved trust issues and lingering emotional wounds make reconciliation difficult. Dylan remains emotionally unstable, and Brenda struggles to feel secure again.",

Jim often disapproves of Dylan’s influence and tries to limit their involvement, believing that Dylan’s difficult past and lifestyle make him unreliable. These conflicts create resentment between the two, with Dylan feeling judged and misunderstood.",

When she is present, she offers guidance and stability, becoming one of the few adults he truly trusts.",

                "Dylan and Iris McKay’s relationship is defined by warmth, understanding, and emotional distance. Unlike Jack, Iris is not involved in crime and generally wants what is best for her son. However, her frequent travels and unconventional lifestyle mean that she is often physically absent from Dylan’s life, leaving him without consistent parental support.",
                "Because Iris is not always present, Dylan grows up learning to rely on himself. While he knows that his mother loves him, he also feels that she is unable to provide the structure and protection he needs. This contributes to his strong independence and emotional guardedness. He becomes used to handling problems alone rather than turning to family for help.",
                "When Iris does appear in Dylan’s life, she is usually portrayed as calm, thoughtful, and emotionally perceptive. She recognizes Dylan’s sensitivity and understands the pain caused by Jack’s absence and criminal past. Unlike many other adults in his life, Iris listens to him without judgment and respects his intelligence and emotional depth.",
                "During Dylan’s darkest periods — especially after his father’s death and during his struggles with addiction — Iris plays an important supportive role. She encourages him to seek healthier ways of coping and reminds him that he is worthy of love and stability. In some cases, she even steps in to help guide him toward recovery and self-reflection.",
                "However, Iris’s tendency to leave again after offering support reinforces Dylan’s fear of abandonment. Even though her departures are not meant to hurt him, they unintentionally deepen his sense that people he loves will eventually disappear. This pattern influences how he approaches romantic relationships, often keeping emotional distance to protect himself.",
                "Despite these challenges, Dylan deeply respects and cares for his mother. He sees her as emotionally honest and morally grounded, and he values her advice. Their relationship lacks daily closeness, but it is built on mutual understanding and genuine affection.",
                "Overall, Dylan and Iris’s relationship represents a quieter, more nurturing influence in his life compared to his turbulent bond with Jack. While Iris cannot always provide stability, she gives Dylan emotional validation and compassion. Her presence reminds him that he is not alone, even when he feels abandoned, and helps shape his capacity for empathy and self-awareness.",

This reflects Dylan’s strong sense of loyalty and his desire to break the cycle of abandonment that defined his own childhood.",

Brandon’s honesty and moral integrity gradually break through Dylan’s emotional defenses, giving him his first genuine male friendship. Through Brandon, Dylan becomes more integrated into the core friend group, though he still maintains his reserved nature.",

Their relationship begins as a passionate and intense attraction and quickly develops into one of the show’s central romances.

However, his fear of commitment and emotional instability often create tension between them.",

Dylan struggles with feelings of resentment, disappointment, and longing for parental approval. These unresolved family conflicts contribute to his emotional guardedness and occasional reckless behavior.",

              "In Season 1 of Beverly Hills, 90210, Kelly Taylor is initially presented as one of the most popular and glamorous girls at West Beverly High. She is confident, fashion-forward, and socially influential, often appearing self-assured on the surface. However, as the season progresses, the show gradually reveals her emotional vulnerabilities and complex family background.",
              "Kelly’s most significant storyline in Season 1 revolves around her relationship with Dylan McKay. Although Dylan is initially distant and emotionally guarded, Kelly is drawn to him and tries to break through his defenses. Their relationship develops slowly, marked by moments of misunderstanding and insecurity. Kelly often feels unsure about Dylan’s feelings and struggles with jealousy, especially when he grows closer to Brenda Walsh. This creates early tension in what will later become one of the show’s central love triangles.",
              "Another important aspect of Kelly’s character arc involves her family life. She lives primarily with her mother, Jackie Taylor, whose history of addiction and unstable relationships affects Kelly deeply. Although this background is not fully explored in Season 1, hints are given that Kelly has grown up too quickly and has learned to be emotionally independent. Her strained relationship with her absent father also contributes to her desire for stability and affection.",
              "Kelly also deals with issues related to self-image and social expectations. As one of the school’s “popular girls,” she feels pressure to maintain a perfect appearance and reputation. This sometimes leads her to act defensively or superficially, masking her insecurities. Despite her popularity, she often feels lonely and unsure of her true worth beyond her looks and status.",
              "Throughout the season, Kelly’s friendship with Brenda Walsh plays an important role in her development. While they are close friends, subtle rivalry and tension emerge, especially due to their shared connection to Dylan. Kelly struggles between loyalty to Brenda and her growing romantic feelings, revealing her internal conflict between friendship and personal desire.",
              "By the end of Season 1, Kelly has evolved from a stereotypical “popular girl” into a more layered and sympathetic character. The audience sees her emotional sensitivity, her longing for genuine connection, and her struggle to balance independence with vulnerability. These early storylines lay the foundation for Kelly’s deeper personal growth and major conflicts in later seasons.",

              "In Season 2, Kelly Taylor remains a key part of the West Beverly High group as they enter their junior year, though much of the season’s focus shifts to multiple ensemble storylines rather than a single central arc for her. She continues to be socially popular and connected with the core friend group, navigating the ups and downs of teenage life alongside Brandon, Brenda, Dylan, Steve, Donna, Andrea, and the others as they deal with relationships, school pressures, and personal growth.",
              "A notable development for Kelly this season is her involvement with Jake Hanson, a character introduced late in Season 2 whose storyline would help launch the spin-off Melrose Place. Jake is an older, emotionally guarded biker and occasional love interest for Kelly; although there is mutual attraction, he makes it clear he is uncomfortable with her being in high school, and their relationship proves fleeting.",
              "Throughout the season, Kelly’s romantic life and emotional maturity remain in transition. After the intense ups and downs of Season 1 — especially her complicated feelings for Dylan McKay — the sophomore year doesn’t give her a long-term steady partner, but it does allow viewers to see her experiment with new connections, handle the normal challenges of high school friendships and dating, and reflect her growing self-awareness.",
              "While Kelly doesn’t face a major individual crisis this season, she continues to influence and support her friends’ stories, remaining emotionally involved in the group’s collective dramas and social dynamics. This positions her as both a loyal friend and an evolving character whose experiences in Season 2 help lay the groundwork for deeper personal and relationship arcs in later seasons."

The season begins with the group spending the summer in Paris, where Kelly grows closer to Dylan McKay while Brenda is distracted and emotionally distant. During this trip, Kelly and Dylan share intimate moments that mark the beginning of a secret emotional—and later romantic—connection, setting the stage for one of the show’s most important conflicts.",
              "As the season continues, Kelly and Dylan begin a hidden relationship behind Brenda’s back. Although Kelly has genuine feelings for Dylan, she is deeply conflicted about betraying her best friend. She struggles with guilt and self-doubt, often questioning her own morality and loyalty. This internal conflict becomes a defining part of her arc, showing her vulnerability and emotional complexity more clearly than in earlier seasons.",
              "When Brenda eventually discovers the truth about Kelly and Dylan’s relationship, the fallout is intense and painful. Kelly is forced to confront the consequences of her actions, losing Brenda’s trust and damaging one of her most important friendships. The love triangle becomes the emotional core of the season, with Kelly caught between her desire for Dylan and her regret over hurting Brenda. This period marks a major turning point in her character, as she can no longer rely on popularity or charm to avoid emotional responsibility.",
              "Despite the tension, Kelly gradually steps into a more serious and mature relationship with Dylan. Their bond deepens as they support each other through personal struggles, and Kelly begins to see herself as more than just “the popular girl.” She becomes more introspective, sensitive, and aware of her own flaws, signaling her transition into a more emotionally grounded character.",
              "By the end of Season 3, Kelly has undergone significant personal growth. She emerges as a more complex and layered individual—someone who has made serious mistakes but is learning from them.

Kelly often finds herself in the role of emotional caretaker, trying to support Dylan while also feeling increasingly lonely and uncertain about their future together.",
              "Kelly also faces challenges related to self-worth and personal validation. As she adjusts to college life, she compares herself to others academically and socially, sometimes feeling inadequate despite her outward confidence. These insecurities make her more sensitive to rejection and criticism, revealing that her polished exterior still masks deep emotional vulnerability.",
              "Throughout the season, Kelly becomes more involved in serious emotional and social issues, reflecting the show’s shift toward darker and more realistic storylines.

Her experiences with Dylan, college life, and evolving friendships help solidify her transformation from a high-school “popular girl” into a thoughtful young woman facing adult realities.

After struggling with insecurity and pressure to succeed, Kelly becomes dependent on diet pills and stimulants to cope with stress, gradually slipping into substance abuse. At first, she denies that anything is wrong, but her behavior becomes increasingly erratic, affecting her health, her studies, and her relationships.",
             "As her addiction worsens, Kelly’s emotional vulnerability makes her susceptible to outside influence. She becomes involved with a self-help group that slowly reveals itself to be a manipulative cult. The group exploits her fragile state, encouraging her to cut ties with her friends and become emotionally dependent on its leader.

He finds a place to stay in the posh home of the Cohens in the wealthy community of Newport Beach, the O.C. (Orange County), California. Ryan is accepted by the stern but compassionate Sandford 'Sandy' Cohen, a lawyer who has represented Ryan in the past for his misdeeds. But Sandy's wife, Kirsten, aware of Ryan's criminal history, is wary of this new house guest. The Cohen's son, Seth, bonds with Ryan quickly and shows him the ropes of the community -- and vice-versa with Ryan giving advice to Seth about life and love. Ryan develops a crush on Marissa Cooper, a neighbor girl who lives down the street, and he has problems with her not-so-sheltered existence in dealing with her distant father Jimmy and her weak-willed mother Julie. Also, Marissa's best friend, Summer, is oblivious to the crush that Seth has on her, while taking a liking to Ryan. And so begins a new life for Ryan, the Cohens, the Coopers, and generally everyone else in the wealthy, picturesque, secretive, turbulent community in Orange County.",

    plot: "This series follows the eventful lives of some high-school kids in Tree Hill, a small but not too quiet town in North Carolina, where the greatest source of pride is the high school basketball team, the Ravens, since living memory coached by old Whitey Durham. Its greatest talent ever was Dan Scott, who now runs a successful car dealership. The present talents are his two sons, Nathan Scott, a beautiful and popular athlete, the absolute star, who was molded and stifled by his proud dad, ambitious Dan Scott, who pushes him harder then even the coach approves of, but rather neglected by his spoiled, impulsive mother Deb, an alcoholic, and Lucas, abandoned at birth with his devoted mother, hard-working café-owner Karen Roe, who grew up with Dan's older but poor brother Keith as substitute father as a social reject, only playing hoops on a public yard in the park with street-kids, his passion being reading; when an incident forces the coach to replace suspended players, Lucas soon proves the revelation, and after a while gets accepted and develops a dynamic, in the long run good relationship with his brother, who turns on his dad. Of course the teenage boys have friends, and especially a confusing series of usually short-loved 'eternal' love affairs with musical talents Peyton and Haley, also a tutor, and irresistible man-eater Brooke...",

Unfortunately, Jenna's visibility comes on the heels of an accident that gives her a not-so-fun stigma that could be the curse of her life, but she is determined to make it her life's blessing.",

    plot: "The show, set in San Francisco, centered on the five Salinger siblings, who become orphans after their parents are killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The family is composed of 24-year-old Charlie (Matthew Fox), the eldest, a womanizing, immature manual laborer who struggles with the responsibility of being the new head of the family; 16-year-old Bailey (Scott Wolf), the once-rebellious teen forced into a role of responsible caretaker and later veering into alcoholism; 15-year-old Julia (Neve Campbell), a sensitive teen; 11-year-old Claudia (Lacey Chabert), a precocious child prodigy musician; and baby Owen, age one.",
